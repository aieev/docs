**Air Cloud** is a cloud computing platform built to run AI inference at scale. Whether you're deploying for real-time AI services or cost-sensitive workloads, Air Cloud gives you two options:

- **Air Cloud**: A distributed, crowd-sourced GPU infrastructure offering the lowest possible pricing through our trusted GPU network.
- **Air Cloud+**: Proprietary GPU devices operated by AIEEV, offering guaranteed uptime, performance, and availability.

Forget complex configurations and overpriced legacy cloud platforms. Traditional bare-metal GPU clouds often fall short in dynamic, production-grade environments — Air Cloud is purpose-built to solve that.

## Choose Your Deployment Method

- **Air Container**: Seamlessly deploy containers from public or private repositories (AWS, GitHub, Docker Hub, Google). Just enter your image address and secure token, and you're good to go.
- **Air Model** (Coming Q3 2025): Designed for faster AI inference with serverless, pay-per-second billing. Automatically pulls your models, sets up REST endpoints, and enables autoscaling for your production workloads.
- **Air API** (Coming Q3 2025): Offers OpenAI-compatible REST API endpoints using open-source models like Whisper, LLaMA 3.3 8B, Solar Mini, and D.N.A. Features serverless.

## Choose Your Infrastructure

- **Air Cloud**: A distributed network of over 10,000 GPUs in Korea, sourced from our secure peer-to-peer partner network. We’ve pre-secured 1,000+ GPUs that can be dynamically assigned to your job at ultra-competitive pricing.
- **Air Cloud+**: AIEEV-owned GPU servers designed specifically for AI inference, offering high availability, service stability, and enterprise-grade security.

## Our Mission

We make cloud computing accessible and affordable for everyone — without compromising performance, reliability, or usability. Our goal is to empower both individuals and enterprises to unlock the full potential of AI and scalable infrastructure.
