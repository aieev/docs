Welcome to Air Cloud. This step-by-step guide will get you up and running with your first deployment in under 5 minutes.

To launch your resources, you'll need both a billing account and at least one project. The onboarding flow in the console guides you through this.

## Creating an Account

  />
</Frame>

Start by signing up for an Air Cloud account to manage and access your deployments.
You can sign up using GitHub, Google, or Email ID. Once registered, log in to begin
using the platform.

## Adding Funds

New users receive $20 in credit upon registration. To deploy resources, you must fund your account. As of now, AIEEV accepts bank transfers only. Credit card and automated payment support will be added by Early June 2025.

To load your balance, email us at [sales@aieev.com](mailto:sales@aieev.com) â€” our team will respond immediately. Bulk credits and reserved-resource discounts are available.

## Creating a Project

Once your account is funded, create a project to deploy and organize your workloads. You can deploy multiple containers, models, or APIs within a single project to match your AI service architecture.

## Managing Your Team

You can either create a personal account or get invited by a team member.

- **Sign Up**: Use GitHub, Google, or Email ID.
- **Invite Team Members**: Admin users can invite teammates via email through the Member Management page. Team members must register using the exact email address they were invited with. After registration, they must accept the invite to join the organization and project.
- **Role Types**: Admins can manage team settings, invite/delete members, and remove projects. Users have limited access to deployment and monitoring tools only.

<Warning>
  If a user receives an invite, ensure they log out from all accounts before
  accepting the invitation to avoid errors (e.g., 404 page).
</Warning>

## Billing Information

- **Air Container** and **Air Model** are billed hourly. For full pricing details, see our [Billing FAQ](https://www.aieev.com/pricing).
- **Payment Method**: As of May 2025, only local and international wire transfers are supported. Credit card support is coming in Q3 2025.
