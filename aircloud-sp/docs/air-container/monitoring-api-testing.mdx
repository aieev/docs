- **Single Request Test**: Use Postman or similar tools to test your vLLM container endpoint.
- **Autoscaling Test**: Use Locust to simulate load and validate replica scaling.
- **Usage Metrics**: Monitor replica count, request rate, and system response time.
- **Runtime Logs**:
  - Logs are displayed per container instance and replica.
  - You can access real-time and historical logs from the Air Cloud dashboard.
  - Logs are shown in reverse chronological order.
  - Use filters to view logs by time range, container, or instance ID.
  - Logs include startup command output, health check status, error messages, and stdout/stderr of model servers.
  - If your container fails, logs will be preserved for a limited retention window for debugging.
- **Settings**: You can update endpoint settings only when the container is stopped.
